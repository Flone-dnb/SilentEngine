            This engine is intended only for educational purposes, not for actual games (although you can make games
            with
            it).
            Because the engine is pretty small, but already a complex system, this documentation shows how to use the
            engine
            correctly (in case I forgot how to use it).
        </p>
        <p>
            When using this engine always remember 2 main rules:
        <ol>
            <li>Carefully read the function documentation (Visual Studio will show it when using the function, otherwise
                just go to the
                file with function). Even if you know how to use this function, read the function documentation again.
            </li>
            <li>All loaded, registered, compiler and etc. stuff needs to be manually unloaded, unregistered and etc.
                (use function like
                SContainer::unbindMaterials(), SApplication::unregisterMaterial(),
                SApplication::unloadCompiledShaderFromGPU(),
                SApplication::unloadTextureFromGPU() and etc.)</li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, to unload a texture, first, despawn an object that uses the material with this texture, then
            unregister the
            material and unload the texture.
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to work with the engine, you need to have a Visual Studio with C++20 support.
        </p>
        <p>
            This "tutorial" will only cover some tricky parts of the engine, for everything else read the documentation in the "ref"
            folder.
        </p>
