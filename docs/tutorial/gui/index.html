            To convert a .ttf to .spritefont use /ext/ttf2bmp.exe and then /ext/MakeSpriteFont.exe to convert .bmp to
            .spritefont.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's better to have a .spritefont per language and keep only one .spritefont in the memory. Keep them small
            (less or equal to 256 chars). For example,
            300
            SGUISimpleText instances (when .spritefont has 256 chars) will use ~0.5 GB.
        </p>
        <p>
            For non-ascii characters in .spritefont you can, for example, use FontForge to insert needed characters
            after 127
            characters in .ttf. Then in ttf2bmp use 0x20 as a start point and in the makeSpriteFont set the default
            character (so
            the app won't throw exceptions on unknown characters), after that, before calling setText() look if the
            character code
            is bigger than 127, then subtract needed characters count.
        </p>
        <p>
            SizeToKeep ignores rotation.
        </p>

            To make a button, you can use SGUIImage (with setInteractableEvents() function) and SGUISimpleText.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can make a progress bar using SGUIImage and SGUIImage::setCut() function.
