            In order to attach a camera to something, like a head of your character, and have it in the component
            hierarchy, you
            need to use STargetComponent.
        </p>
        <p>
            Add STargetComponent to the component hierarchy. It will be used as a placeholder for camera location.
        </p>
        <p>
            Use SComponent::setBindOnParentLocationRotationScaleChangedCallback() on this STargetComponent and set
            camera location in this
            function based on
            the STargetComponent location in world.
        </p>
        <p>
            This way you can have a first person camera, for example.
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to have a third person camera, you can use SCamera::setCameraMode() with CM_FIXED.
        </p>
