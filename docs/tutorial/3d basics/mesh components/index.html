        <p>
            Silent engine has 2 mesh components:
        <ul>
            <li>SMeshComponent</li>
            <li>SRuntimeMeshComponent</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            SMeshComponent is used for the geometry, that will be rarely changed via SMeshComponent::setMeshData().
        </p>
        <p>
            SRuntimeMeshComponent is used for the geometry, that will be often changed via
            SMeshComponent::setMeshData().
        </p>
        <p>
            The SRuntimeMeshComponent has some optimizations so that changing the mesh data from the CPU side won't
            affect the performance that bad.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you want to have a mesh, that will change its geometry very often (once
            per frame, for example), then choose
            SRuntimeMeshComponent for your mesh.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the other hand, if you want to change mesh geometry (often) from the GPU side (via compute shaders), then
            you
            need to pick
            SMeshComponent, because it's optimized to have more performance via updates from GPU.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the geometry of a mesh won't be changed, pick SMeshComponent.
        </p>
