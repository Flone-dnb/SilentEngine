# Silent Engine

Still in very early development stage, right now we got:
- entity component system,
- custom audio engine with FX and 3D positioning (using XAudio2),
- frustum culling,
- instancing,
- easy interface for working with compute shaders,
- easy interface for adding custom shaders (vertex/pixel),
- simple GUI (made with SpriteBatch/SpriteFont from DirectXTK),
- OBJ file import,
- simple profiler,
- shadow mapping.
